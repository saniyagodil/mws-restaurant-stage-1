#### _Three Stage Course Project - Restaurant Reviews_

### What was the project?

I was provided with "the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality."

### What did I do?

1. I implemented new user features: the ability to write reviews or favorite restaurants
2. I modified the site to encorporate responsive design so that it would work well on computers, tablets and phones
3. I implemented service workers and indexDB promised to allow many of the website's features to be used offline
4. I optimized performance and added in standard accessibility features

### How to Run?

1. Run the API Server from https://github.com/saniyagodil/mws-restaurant-stage-3
2. In this folder, start up the HTTP server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
3. With your HTTP server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
